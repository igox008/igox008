### Hi buddy ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ahmed (but you can call me *IGO*), a passionate and curious learner enrolled at 1337 School in Morocco. I believe in the power of technology to bring positive change to the world, and I'm on a mission to sharpen my coding skills to make a meaningful impact.
Let's code the future together! ðŸš€
